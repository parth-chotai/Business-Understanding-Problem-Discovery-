The BUPD stage is where we develop a specific understanding of the business processes. And where we try to concretely define the problem we'll be working on. There's only high-level focus on data in this stage. Among the four stages of the MLPL, this stage is primarily about strategically aligning business process with the execution of the project. Correctly understanding the business functions can save you a lot of time down the road. Taking your time in this stage is a good idea so that you don't jump into a machine learning solution that builds on incorrect assumptions. And does not align with the business problems you care about.
